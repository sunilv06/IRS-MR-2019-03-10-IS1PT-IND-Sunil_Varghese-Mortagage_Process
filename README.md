Mortgage Loan Approval Process**

**Section 2 : Executive Summary / Paper Abstract**
With the advent of mortgage loans, it became affordable  for home buyers to purchase a home very early in their careers.
However the lending organizations needs to check on various criteria before extending a loan.
The accompanying system simulates a business process having both automated machine reasoning steps as well as human actors to complete the whole process of a home loan application and approval.

The process provided tries to reduce the human actors if the corresponding step can be automated, at the same time it keeps the human actors where machine reasoning may not be adequate.
The process contains 2 decision tables to check on the various criterias before the application reaches the final approval.

Using this system a well reasoned case can be made on whether to extend a loan to a loan requester.
